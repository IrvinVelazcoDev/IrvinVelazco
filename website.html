    <h1>This is the start of my website</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Irvin Velazco, and this is my website. I want to play Earthbound on my iPhone, so that's going to be my first project. More specifically, I want to build a website that I can use myself to play Earthbound. It should work well with my phone, save all my data, and be seamless like an emulator.
    </p>
    <h2>How would I do this?</h2>
    <p>
        Honestly, I have no clue. I just want to play video games on my phone but can't because iPhones are unfun with emulators.
